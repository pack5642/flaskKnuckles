# flaskKnuckles
Playing around with with web devlopment using flask and memes!

First time putting together a website and decided to go with flask since I have some python experience. 
The website is barebones but it was a very enjoyable experience making it and I was able to learn a lot through making minute changes
to all the different parts of the code.
